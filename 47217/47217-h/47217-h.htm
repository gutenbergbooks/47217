<p>At 4:30 A. M., April 12, 1861, a mortar battery at Fort Johnson fired
a shell that burst directly over Fort Sumter. This was the signal
for a general bombardment by the Confederate batteries about
Charleston Harbor. For 34 hours, April 12 and 13, Fort Sumter was battered
with shot and shell. Then the Federal commander, Maj. Robert
Anderson, agreed to evacuate; and, on April 14, he and his small garrison
departed with the full honors of war. On the following day, President
Abraham Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 militia. The tragedy of the
American Civil War had begun.</p>
<p>Two years later, Fort Sumter, now a Confederate stronghold, became
the scene of a stubborn defense. From April 1863 to February 1865 its
garrison withstood a series of devastating bombardments and direct
attacks by Federal forces from land and sea. Fort Sumter was evacuated
only when Federal forces bypassed Charleston from the rear. At the end,
buttressed with sand and cotton as well as its own fallen brick and
masonry, it was stronger than ever militarily. And it had become a symbol
of resistance and courage for the entire South.</p>
<p>Both the &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; of April 1861 and the long siege of 1863-65 are
commemorated today by Fort Sumter National Monument.</p>

</div>
<p>The War of 1812 had shown the gross inadequacy of the coastal
defenses of the United States. The crowning indignity had been the
burning of Washington. Accordingly, Congress now answered President
Madison&rsquo;s call by setting up a military Board of Engineers for Seacoast
Fortifications to devise a new system of national defense. Brig. Gen.
Simon Bernard, the famed military engineer of Napoleon, was commissioned
in the Corps of Engineers and assigned to the Board. Under his
unofficial direction, the Board began surveying the entire coast line of
the United States in 1817. The South Atlantic coast, &ldquo;especially regarded
as less important,&rdquo; was not surveyed until 1821. One fortification report,
covering the Gulf coast and the Atlantic coast between Cape Hatteras
and the St. Croix River, had been submitted to Congress earlier that year.
Thus, not till the revised form of this report was submitted to Congress
in 1826 was the possibility that the &ldquo;shoal opposite [Fort Moultrie] may
be occupied permanently&rdquo; officially broached. This was the genesis of
Fort Sumter. If the location were feasible, reported the Board, &ldquo;the fortification
of the harbor may be considered as an easy and simple problem.&rdquo;
With the guns of the projected fort crossing fire with those of Fort
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Moultrie, the commercial city of Charleston would be most effectively
protected against attack.</p>
<p>Plans for the new fort were drawn up in 1827 and adopted on December
5, 1828. In the course of that winter Lt. Henry Brewerton, Corps of
Engineers, assumed charge of the project and active operations were commenced.
Progress was slow, however, and as late as 1834 the new fort
was no more than a hollow pentagonal rock &ldquo;mole&rdquo; 2 feet above low
water and open at one side to permit supply ships to pass to the interior.
Meanwhile, it had been named Sumter in honor of Thomas Sumter, of
South Carolina, the &ldquo;Gamecock&rdquo; of the Revolution.</p>

</div>
<p>Late in the autumn of 1834 operations were suddenly suspended.
Ownership of the site was in question. In the preceding May, one
William Laval, resident of Charleston, had secured from the State a conveniently
vague grant to 870 acres of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in Charleston Harbor. In
November, acting under this grant, Laval notified the representative of
the United States Engineers at Fort Johnson of his claim to the site of
Fort Sumter. In the meantime, the South Carolina Legislature had
become curious about the operations in Charleston Harbor. Late in
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
November, inquiry had been instituted as to &ldquo;whether the creation of
an Island on a shoal in the Channel, may not injuriously affect the navigation
and commerce of [Charleston] Harbor....&rdquo; Reporting the
following month, the Committee on Federal Relations had made the
ominous pronouncement that they had not &ldquo;been able to ascertain by
what authority the Government have assumed to erect the works alluded
to....&rdquo; Apparently under the impression that a formal deed of cession
to &ldquo;land&rdquo; ordinarily covered with water had not been necessary, the Federal
Government had commenced operations at the mouth of Charleston
Harbor without consulting the State of South Carolina.</p>
<p>It was not until January 1841 that work was resumed on the site of
Fort Sumter. Laval&rsquo;s claim was invalidated by the State attorney general
under act of the South Carolina Legislature, December 20, 1837. But the
harbor issue remained and was complicated still further by a memorial
presented to the legislature by James C. Holmes, Charleston lawyer, on
that same date. Not before November 22, 1841, was the Federal Government&rsquo;s
title to 125 acres of harbor &ldquo;land&rdquo; recorded in the office of the
Secretary of State of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Under the skilful guidance of Capt. A. H. Bowman, the work was now
pushed forward. The original plans were changed in several respects.
Perhaps the most important modification was with respect to the foundation.
Instead of a &ldquo;grillage of continuous square timbers&rdquo; upon the
rock mass, Bowman&rsquo;s idea of laying several courses of granite blocks was
adopted, in the main. Bowman had feared the complete destruction of
the wood by worms; and palmetto, which might have resisted such
attack, had not the compactness of fiber or the necessary strength to
support the weight of the superstructure.</p>
<p>The work was difficult. The granite of the foundation, for example,
was laid between high and low watermarks, and there were periods of
time when the tide permitted no work to be done at all. Yellow fever
was a recurrent problem; so was the excessive heat of the Charleston
summers. Much of the building material had to be brought in from the
north. The magnitude of the task is indicated by the quantities involved:
about 10,000 tons of granite (some of it from as far away as the Penobscot
River region in Maine) and well over 60,000 tons of other rock.
Bricks, shells, and sand could be obtained locally, but even here there
were problems. Local brickyard capacities were small and millions of
bricks were required. Similarly, hundreds of thousands of bushels of
shells were needed&mdash;for concrete, for the foundation of the first-tier casemate
floors, and for use in the parade fill next to the enrockment. Even
the actual delivery of supplies, however local in origin, was a problem,
for then, as now, Fort Sumter was a difficult spot at which to land.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter in December 1860 was a five-sided brick masonry fort
designed for three tiers of guns. Its 5-foot-thick outer walls, towering
nearly 50 feet above low water, enclosed a parade ground of roughly 1
acre. Along four of the walls extended two tiers of arched gunrooms.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Officers&rsquo; quarters lined the fifth side&mdash;the 316.7-foot gorge. This wall was
to be armed only along the parapet. Three-story brick barracks for the
enlisted garrison paralleled the gunrooms on each flank. At the center
of the gorge was the sally port. It opened on the 25&frac12;-foot-wide stone
esplanade that extended the length of that wall and on a 171-foot wharf.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b><i>Spiking the guns at Fort Moultrie, just prior to departure for Fort Sumter, December 26, 1860.</i></b> From Frank Leslie&rsquo;s Illustrated Newspaper, January 5, 1861.</p>
</div>
<p>Fort Sumter was unfinished when, late in December, gathering events
prompted its occupation by artillery troops. Eight-foot-square openings
yawned in place of gun embrasures on the second tier. Of the 135 guns
planned for the gunrooms and the open terreplein above, only 15 had
been mounted. Most of these were &ldquo;32 pounders&rdquo;; none was heavier.
Various details of the interior finish of barracks, quarters, and gunrooms
were incomplete. Congressional economies had had their effect, as much
as difficulties of construction. As late as 1858 and 1859, work had been
virtually at a standstill for lack of funds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small"><i>Major Anderson Moves Garrison from Moultrie to Sumter</i></span></h2>
<p>On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union. On the
night of the 26th, fearing attack by the excited populace, Maj. Robert
Anderson removed the small garrison he commanded at Fort Moultrie to
Fort Sumter out in the harbor. Ignorant of an apparent pledge to maintain
the harbor <i>status quo</i>, given by President Buchanan some weeks
before, Anderson moved in accordance with instructions received
December 11, which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are
to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit
you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt
to take possession of any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you
may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper
to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar steps
whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anderson thought he had &ldquo;tangible evidence&rdquo; of hostile intent, both
towards Fort Moultrie&mdash;an old fort most vulnerable to land attack&mdash;and
towards unoccupied Fort Sumter. He moved now &ldquo;to prevent the effusion
of blood&rdquo; and because he was certain &ldquo;that if attacked my men must
have been sacrificed, and the command of the harbor lost.&rdquo; To Anderson,
a Kentuckian married to a Georgia girl, preservation of peace was of
paramount importance. At the same time, a veteran soldier of &ldquo;unquestioned
loyalty,&rdquo; he had a duty to perform.</p>
<p>Charleston was filled with excitement and rage. Crowds collected in
the streets; military organizations paraded; and &ldquo;loud and violent were
the expressions of feeling against Major Anderson and his action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was almost as much consternation in Washington as in Charleston.
Senators calling at the White House found President Buchanan
greatly agitated. He stood by the mantelpiece, crushing a cigar in the
palm of one hand, and stammered that the move was against his policy.
The cabinet was called into session, and on December 27, Secretary of
War Floyd wired Major Anderson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligence has reached here this morning that you have abandoned Fort Moultrie,
... and gone to Fort Sumter. It is not believed, because there is no order for
any such movement. Explain the meaning of this report.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>South Carolina regarded Anderson&rsquo;s move not only as an &ldquo;outrageous
breach of faith,&rdquo; but as an act of aggression, and demanded, through
commissioners, that the United States Government evacuate Charleston
Harbor. President Buchanan, anxious to conciliate as well as maintain
authority, wavered. Cabinet pressures were brought to bear. Meanwhile,
on the 27th, South Carolina volunteers seized Castle Pinckney and Fort
Moultrie. On the 28th, the President refused to accede to South Carolina&rsquo;s
demand.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The North was exultant. Amid cheers for Major Anderson, salvos of
artillery resounded in northern cities on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1861. By
an imposing majority, the House of Representatives voted approval of
Major Anderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;bold and patriotic&rdquo; act.</p>
<p>At Fort Sumter, Major Anderson had two companies of the First
United States Artillery&mdash;about 85 officers and men in a fortification
intended for as many as 650. He had only &ldquo;about 4 months&rdquo; supply of
provisions for his command. The question of reenforcement and supply
was to trouble all the remaining days of the Buchanan administration
and to carry over to the succeeding administration. In it were the seeds
of war.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Star of the West</i></span></h2>
<p>President Buchanan was persuaded to send off a relief expedition almost
immediately. Initial plans called for the dispatch of the sloop of war
<i>Brooklyn</i> for this purpose, but when word came which indicated that the
South Carolinians had obstructed the harbor entrance by sinking several
ships, it was decided to use an ordinary merchant ship. The <i>Brooklyn</i>, of
heavy draft, could probably not now pass into the harbor. A merchant
ship would certainly excite less suspicion and would avoid the appearance
of a coercive movement. Accordingly, the <i>Star of the West</i>&mdash;a ship
which regularly sailed southward from New York&mdash;was chartered. Two
hundred men, small arms and ammunition, and several months&rsquo; provisions
were placed aboard. The men were to remain below deck on
entering Charleston Harbor; the <i>Brooklyn</i> would follow, in case the <i>Star
of the West</i> were fired upon and disabled.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="The Star of the West. From Battles and Leaders of the Civil War." width="500" height="274" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The</i> <b>Star of the West</b>. From <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>But Charleston was forewarned. When the <i>Star of the West</i> appeared at
the entrance of the harbor on January 9, 1861, Citadel cadets opened fire
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
with a gun mounted on Cummings Point; and the merchant ship,
unarmed, steamed out of the harbor. Anderson had held his fire, thinking
the firing unauthorized by the State authorities. Orders authorizing
supporting fire on his part had failed to reach him in time. As if accidentally,
civil war had been averted for the moment.</p>
<p>There was some Northern reaction to the incident, but further plans
for Anderson&rsquo;s relief, once projected, were delayed. Anderson indicated
no immediate need, and President Buchanan was anxious to end his term
of office in peace. On January 10, the Secretary of War had ordered Major
Anderson to act &ldquo;strictly on the defensive.&rdquo; Anderson and Governor
Pickens of South Carolina exchanged angry letters, and the Governor&rsquo;s
demand for the fort&rsquo;s surrender (January 11) was resolved in the &ldquo;mission&rdquo;
to Washington of the State&rsquo;s attorney general, I. G. Hayne. When
that mission, tempered by the efforts of cooler-headed Southern Senators,
met stubborn resistance on the part of President Buchanan, the situation
was resolved in the formation of the Southern Confederacy, with the
consequent assumption of the Fort Sumter problem by that government.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small"><i>Preparations for War</i></span></h2>
<p>Fort Sumter was now preparing for attack. Thirty-eight more guns were
mounted in the first tier of casemates and along the parapet, including
heavier &ldquo;42 pounders&rdquo; and Columbiads. Five Columbiads were mounted
in the parade as mortars and three howitzers about the sally port in the
gorge. By April 12, a total of 60 guns was ready. &ldquo;Bombproof&rdquo; shelters
and &ldquo;splinter-proof&rdquo; traverses were constructed on the parade ground
and along the parapet. Overhanging galleries were built out from the
parapet at strategic points for dropping shells on an assaulting force.
Special protection was given the gateway. Left unarmed, however, was
the second tier of casemates; the 8-foot-square openings in the outer wall
were bricked up. The small size of Major Anderson&rsquo;s garrison did not
permit manning it.</p>
<p>Charleston, too, prepared. In addition to routine preparations at Castle
Pinckney and Fort Moultrie, additional batteries were prepared on Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island, at Cummings Point on Morris Island, and outside Fort
Johnson. An &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; Columbiad battery, constructed of inclined logs
plated with iron, was mounted at Cummings Point. Meanwhile, Governor
Pickens permitted Anderson to buy fresh meat and vegetables in
town to supplement his garrison &ldquo;issue&rdquo; supply.</p>
<p>On February 4, 1861, delegates from six seceding States&mdash;South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana&mdash;had met at
Montgomery, Ala., to form the Confederate government. A constitution
had been adopted and Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, had been elected
President and inaugurated on February 18. Texas came into the Confederacy
on March 2. By this time all forts, arsenals, and navy yards in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
seceding States had been seized by the Confederate government without
resistance, except Fort Pickens on Pensacola Bay in Florida, two minor
forts (Jefferson and Taylor) on and near the Florida coast, and Fort Sumter.
Because of its association with the &ldquo;hotbed of secession&rdquo; and because
of Major Anderson&rsquo;s dramatic move, Fort Sumter had assumed
undeserved importance.</p>
<p>On March 3, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard took command of the
Confederate troops at Charleston. Like Major Anderson, Beauregard was
a veteran of the Mexican War. He was a member of a Louisiana family
of distinguished French lineage. Late captain in the United States Army,
he had served briefly as superintendent of the United States Military
Academy at West Point as recently as January. Once, years back, he had
studied artillery there under Major Anderson; now, pupil confronted
master.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small"><i>Lincoln Orders a Relief Expedition to Fort Sumter</i></span></h2>
<p>On March 4, Abraham Lincoln assumed office as President of the United
States. In a firm, but generally conciliatory, inaugural address, he made it
clear that national authority must be upheld against the threat of disunion.
As to the Federal forts and property in the seceded States he said:
&ldquo;The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess
the property and places belonging to the Government....&rdquo; He did not
say &ldquo;repossess.&rdquo; Furthermore, there needed to be &ldquo;no bloodshed or violence&rdquo;
as the result of this policy &ldquo;unless it be forced upon the national
authority.&rdquo; The President concluded:</p>

<p class="pcap"><b><i>In the face of war preparations, wives and children leave Fort Sumter, February 3, 1861.</i></b> From Frank Leslie&rsquo;s Illustrated Newspaper, February 23, 1861.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous
issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no
conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in
Heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most solemn one to
&lsquo;preserve, protect, and defend&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sumter situation was placed squarely before Lincoln on the day
he assumed office. On the morning of Inaugural Day the outgoing Secretary
of War received a dispatch from Major Anderson at Fort Sumter
indicating that the remainder of the &ldquo;issue&rdquo; rations brought over from
Fort Moultrie in December would last only a few more weeks. Meanwhile,
in the face of local preparations, an estimated force of 20,000 men
would now be needed to reenforce and supply Fort Sumter. It was clear
that if Anderson&rsquo;s local &ldquo;fresh food&rdquo; supply were cut off, he would soon
be in a desperate state. At the same time, it seemed almost equally clear
that a relief expedition would be an impossibility. The entire Army of
the United States numbered less than 16,000 men. &ldquo;Evacuation seems
almost inevitable,&rdquo; wrote General Scott; the majority of Lincoln&rsquo;s Cabinet
agreed. But Lincoln investigated further. In the meantime, reassured
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
by Secretary of State Seward as well as by others, the South came to
believe Fort Sumter would be evacuated.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="pcap"><b><i>Brig. Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard.</i></b> Courtesy National Archives.</p>
</div>
<p>On April 4, President Lincoln sent word to Major Anderson that an
attempt would be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions &ldquo;and, in
case the effort is resisted ... to reenforce you.&rdquo; Convinced from &ldquo;on
the spot&rdquo; reports that such an expedition was feasible, and that there
was no Union sentiment in South Carolina to which to appeal, Lincoln
had decided upon the nearest thing to preserving the <i>status quo</i>. Merchant
steamers under cover of ships of war would carry &ldquo;subsistence and other
supplies&rdquo; to Anderson; the ships of war (with troop reenforcements)
would be used only if a peaceable landing were opposed. Capt. G. V.
Fox, long an advocate of a relief expedition, would command. Meanwhile,
in accordance with pledge already given, the Governor of South
Carolina would be carefully informed in advance.</p>
<p>The announcement of the expedition to supply Fort Sumter was the
spark that set off the explosive forces which had been building up since
1850. The Confederate capital at Montgomery was informed. Anderson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fresh&rdquo; provision supply had already been cut off on the 7th; now, his
mail was seized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Work was pushed on the harbor fortifications. A new battery mounting
two &ldquo;24 pounders&rdquo; and two &ldquo;32 pounders&rdquo; was unmasked on Sullivan&rsquo;s
Island; another ironclad battery was put into position at its western
tip. Originally designed to be &ldquo;floating,&rdquo; this battery mounted two heavy
&ldquo;42 pounders&rdquo; in addition to two &ldquo;32 pounders.&rdquo; Near Mount Pleasant
another (10-inch) mortar battery was installed. At Fort Moultrie, 11 guns
now bore on Fort Sumter, including three 8-inch Columbiads. Additional
guns were mounted to command the channels and to guard against
landings by the fleet. Three thousand more troops were called, to be
added to the 3,700 already on the post. The harbor seethed with activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gage is thrown down,&rdquo; said the Charleston <i>Mercury</i>, &ldquo;and we
accept the challenge. We will meet the invader, and God and Battle must
decide the issue between the hirelings of Abolition hate and Northern
tyranny, and the people of South Carolina defending their freedom and
their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, just in time, a small (12-pounder Blakely) rifled gun arrived
from England as a gift of a Charlestonian, resident in London. It was
mounted at Cummings Point, ominous forerunner of the powerful rifled
guns that 2 years later would reduce Fort Sumter to ruin.</p>

<p>After cabinet debate in Montgomery, the Confederate Secretary of War
ordered General Beauregard to demand the evacuation of the fort, and if
that demand were refused, to &ldquo;reduce it.&rdquo; On the afternoon of April 11,
three of Beauregard&rsquo;s aides visited the fort under a flag of truce and presented
the ultimatum. Major Anderson refused compliance, but at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
same time he said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, if you do not batter the fort to pieces
about us, we shall be starved out in a few days.&rdquo; Still reluctant to initiate
conflict, the Montgomery government telegraphed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do not desire needlessly to bombard Fort Sumter. If Major Anderson will state
the time at which ... he will evacuate, and agree that in the meantime he will not
use his guns against us unless ours should be employed against Fort Sumter, you are
authorized thus to avoid the effusion of blood. If this or its equivalent be refused,
reduce the fort....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The atmosphere in Charleston was tense. In at least one household,
dinner was the &ldquo;merriest, maddest ... yet. Men were more audaciously
wise and witty. We had an unspoken foreboding it was to be our last
pleasant meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight, four Confederate officers confronted Major
Anderson again. About 3 hours later, in a carefully worded reply, the
Union commander agreed to evacuate &ldquo;by noon on the 15th&rdquo; unless he
should receive prior to that time &ldquo;controlling instructions from my
Government or additional supplies.&rdquo; But it was expected in Charleston
that the Federal supply ships would arrive before the 15th. Major Anderson&rsquo;s
reply was rejected by the Confederate officers, who proceeded at
once to Fort Johnson to give the order to open fire.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><br /><span class="small"><i>The War Begins&mdash;April 12, 1861</i></span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I count four by St. Michael&rsquo;s chimes, and I begin to hope. At half past four, the
heavy booming of a cannon! I sprang out of bed and on my knees, prostrate, I prayed
as I never prayed before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 4:30 a. m., a mortar at Fort Johnson fired a shell which arched
across the sky and burst almost directly over Fort Sumter. This was the
signal for opening the bombardment. Within a few minutes, a ring of
guns and mortars about the harbor&mdash;43 in all&mdash;were firing at Sumter.</p>

<p>Major Anderson withheld fire until about 7 o&rsquo;clock. Then Capt. Abner
Doubleday, of latter-day baseball fame, fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery
on Cummings Point. Ominously, the light shot &ldquo;bounded off from
the sloping roof ... without producing any apparent effect.&rdquo; Not at
any time during the battle did the guns of Fort Sumter do great damage
to the Confederate defenses. Most of Fort Sumter&rsquo;s heaviest guns were
on the parapet and in the parade, and, to reduce casualties in the small
garrison, Major Anderson ordered these left unmanned. For a while, with
the help of the 43 engineer workmen remaining at the fort, 9 or 10 of
the casemate guns were manned. But by noon, the expenditure of ammunition
was so much more rapid than the manufacture of new cartridge
bags that the firing was restricted to 6 guns only. Meanwhile</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Showers of balls from 10-inch Columbiads and 42 pounders, and shells from [10]
inch mortars poured into the fort in one incessant stream, causing great flakes of
masonry to fall in all directions. When the immense mortar shells, after sailing high
in the air, came down in a vertical direction, and buried themselves in the parade
ground, their explosion shook the fort like an earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Charleston watched. Business was entirely suspended. King Street
was deserted. The Battery, the wharves and shipping, and &ldquo;every steeple
and cupalo in the city&rdquo; were crowded with anxious spectators. And
&ldquo;never before had such crowds of ladies without attendants&rdquo; visited the
streets of Charleston. &ldquo;The women were wild&rdquo; on the housetops. In the
darkness before dawn there were &ldquo;Prayers from the women and imprecations

day advanced, the city became rife with rumors: &ldquo;Tonight, they say, the
forces are to attempt to land. The <i>Harriet Lane</i> had her wheel house
smashed and put back to sea.... We hear nothing, can listen to nothing.
Boom boom goes the cannon all the time. The nervous strain is
awful....&rdquo; Volunteers rushed to join their companies. There was
&ldquo;Stark Means marching under the piazza at the head of his regiment
...,&rdquo; his proud mother leaning over the balcony rail &ldquo;looking
with tearful eyes.&rdquo; Two members of the Palmetto Guards paid $50 for a
boat to carry them to Morris Island.</p>

<p>The barracks at Fort Sumter caught fire three times that first day, but
each time the fire was extinguished. One gun on the parapet was dismounted;
another damaged. The wall about one embrasure was shattered
to a depth of 20 inches. That was the Blakely rifle, in part, firing with
&ldquo;the accuracy of a duelling pistol.&rdquo; The quarters on the gorge were completely
riddled. When night descended, dark and stormy, Fort Sumter&rsquo;s
fire ceased entirely. With the six needles available, the work of making
cartridge bags went forward; blankets, old clothing, extra hospital sheets,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and even paper, were used in the emergency. In the meantime, the supply
fleet, off the bar since the onset of hostilities, did no more than maintain
its position. It had been crippled upon departure when Seward&rsquo;s
meddling had caused withdrawal of the powerful warship <i>Powhatan</i>.
Now, bad weather prevented even a minimum supporting operation.</p>

</div>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, Sumter opened &ldquo;early and spitefully,&rdquo;
and, with the increased supply of cartridges, for a while kept up a brisk
fire. About midmorning hot shot set fire to the officers&rsquo; quarters. The
Confederate fire then increased; soon the whole extent of the quarters
was in flames; the powder magazines were in danger. The blaze spread
to the barracks. By noon the fort was almost uninhabitable. The men
crowded to the embrasures for air or lay on the ground with handkerchiefs
over their mouths. For a time the fort continued to fire; valiant
efforts had saved some of the powder before the onrush of the flames
forced the closing of the magazines. Meanwhile, at every shot, the Confederate
troops, &ldquo;carried away by their natural generous impulses,&rdquo;
mounted the different batteries and &ldquo;cheered the garrison for its pluck
and gallantry and hooted the fleet lying inactive just outside the bar.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>About 1:30 in the afternoon the flag was shot down. Almost accidentally,
this led to surrender. By authority of General Simons, commanding
on Morris Island, Col. Louis T. Wigfall, one of General Beauregard&rsquo;s
aides detached for duty at that spot, set out by small boat to ascertain
whether Major Anderson would capitulate. Till recently, Wigfall had
been United States Senator from Texas. Before he arrived at the beleaguered
fort, the United States flag was again flying, but Wigfall continued
on. The firing continued from the batteries across the harbor. Once
through an embrasure on the Left Flank, white handkerchief on the point
of his sword, Colonel Wigfall offered the Federal commander any terms
he desired, only &ldquo;the precise nature of which&rdquo; would have to be arranged
with General Beauregard. Anderson accepted on the basis of Beauregard&rsquo;s
original terms: evacuation with his command, taking arms and all
private and company property, saluting the United States flag as it was
lowered, and being conveyed, if desired, to a Northern port. The white
flag went up again; the firing ceased. Wigfall departed confident that
Anderson had surrendered unconditionally. He and his boatman were
borne ashore &ldquo;in triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<p class="pcap"><b><i>Exterior of the Gorge after the April 1861 bombardment. The sally port is at the left.</i></b></p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, officers had arrived at the fort direct from General Beauregard&rsquo;s
headquarters in Charleston. From these men, dispatched to offer
assistance to the Federal commander, Anderson learned that Wigfall&rsquo;s
action was unauthorized; that, indeed, the colonel had not seen the
Commanding General since the start of the battle. From another party
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
of officers he learned Beauregard&rsquo;s exact terms of surrender. They failed
to include the privilege of saluting the flag, though in all other respects
they were the same as those Anderson believed he had accepted from
Wigfall. Impetuously, Anderson had first declared he would run up his
flag again. Then, restrained by Beauregard&rsquo;s aides, he waited while his
request for permission to salute the flag was conveyed to the Commanding
General. In the course of the afternoon, General Beauregard courteously
sent over a fire engine from the city. About 7:30 that evening,
Beauregard&rsquo;s chief of staff returned with word that Major Anderson&rsquo;s
request would be granted and the terms offered on the 11th would be
faithfully adhered to. The engagement was officially at an end. During
the 34-hour bombardment, more than 3,000 shells had been hurled at
the fort.</p>

<p>On Sunday, April 14, Major Anderson and his garrison marched out
of the fort with drums beating and colors flying and boarded ship to join
the Federal fleet off the bar. On the 50th round of what was to have been
a 100-gun salute to the United States flag, there occurred the only fatality
of the engagement. The premature discharge of a gun and the explosion
of a pile of cartridges resulted in the death of Pvt. Daniel Hough.
Another man, mortally wounded, died several days later. The 50th round
was the last. Now, as the steamer <i>Isabel</i> went down the channel, the soldiers
of the Confederate batteries on Cummings Point lined the beach,
silent, heads uncovered.</p>
<p>The following day, April 15, 1861, Abraham Lincoln issued a call for
75,000 militia. Civil war, so long dreaded, had begun. The States of
Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina now joined the
Confederacy.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><br /><span class="small"><i>Charleston and the Federal Blockade&mdash;1861-63</i></span></h2>
<p>With Fort Sumter in Confederate hands, the port of Charleston became
a most irritating loophole in the Federal naval blockade of the Atlantic
coast&mdash;doubly irritating because at Charleston &ldquo;rebellion first lighted the
flame of civil war.&rdquo; As late as January 1863, it was reported that &ldquo;vessels
ply to and from Charleston and Nassau [Bahamas] with the certainty
and promptness of a regular line.&rdquo; In 2 months of the spring following,
21 Confederate vessels cleared Charleston and 15 came in. Into Charleston
came needed war supplies; out went cotton in payment.</p>
<p>Capture of Port Royal Harbor on November 7, 1861, by a Federal fleet
under Capt. Samuel F. Du Pont, however, had made possible land and
sea operations against Charleston. In June 1862, an attempt was made
by Maj. Gen. D. H. Hunter to push through to Charleston by James
Island on the south. This ended in Union disaster at Secessionville.
Meanwhile, the <i>Monitor-Merrimac</i> action in Hampton Roads had indicated
the feasibility of a naval &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; expedition against Fort Sumter,
the key to the harbor. Sumter, now largely rebuilt, had become a formidable
work armed with some 95 guns and garrisoned with upwards of
500 men. In May 1862, the Navy Department had determined to capture
Charleston &ldquo;as soon as Richmond falls.&rdquo; To Du Pont, who was now rear
admiral, there seemed to be a &ldquo;morbid appetite in the land to have
Charleston.&rdquo; The War Department, meanwhile, far from supplying additional
troops to General Hunter&rsquo;s command in South Carolina, withdrew
units to reenforce General McClellan in Virginia.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><br /><span class="small"><i>Federal Ironclads Attack Fort Sumter</i></span></h2>
<p>On April 5, 1863, a fleet of 9 Federal ironclads, armed with 32 guns &ldquo;of
the heaviest calibres ever used in war,&rdquo; appeared off Charleston bar. Seven
were of the single-turret &ldquo;cheesebox on a raft&rdquo; monitor type; one was a
double-turreted affair; the flagship <i>New Ironsides</i> was an ironclad frigate.
With the ebb tide, on the afternoon of the 7th, the &ldquo;newfangled&rdquo; ironclads
steamed single file up the main ship channel east of Morris Island.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
The weather was clear and bright; the water &ldquo;as stable as of a river.&rdquo; By
3 o&rsquo;clock, the <i>Weehawken</i>, the leading monitor, had come within range,
and Fort Moultrie opened fire. The <i>Passaic</i>, second in line, responded.
Fort Sumter held fire, guns trained on a buoy at the turn of the channel.
When the <i>Weehawken</i> came abreast of that point, all the guns atop Sumter&rsquo;s
right flank let loose, followed by all the guns on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island,
at Fort Moultrie, and at Cummings Point that could be brought to bear.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">

</div>
<p>It was too much for the ironclads, slow and unwieldy, possessed of
limited vision, and operating in a narrow and uncertain channel. In the
course of the 2&frac12;-hour fight, only one came as close as 900 yards to Fort
Sumter. To the 2,209 rounds hurled against them, the ironclads were
able to return only 154, of which only 34 found the target. These
breached and loosened the right flank parapet for a length of 25 feet and
pocked the walls elsewhere with craters up to 2&frac12; feet deep. But it was
far from enough; Fort Sumter remained strong and secure. In the meantime,
five of the ironclads were seriously disabled by the accurate fire,
and one, the <i>Keokuk</i>, sank the following morning in the shallow water
off Morris Island. In a daring exploit sometime later, Confederate troops
recovered the guns of the <i>Keokuk</i> and mounted one at Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>Admiral Du Pont had &ldquo;attempted to take the bull by the horns but
had failed.&rdquo; The North, so confident of victory, was stunned at a time
when the general military situation gave cause for gloom. The war in
the East had been bloody and indecisive till now; the news from the
West was bad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Federal authorities looked to a combined operation to seize Morris
Island and from there demolish Fort Sumter. With Fort Sumter reduced,
the harbor could be entered.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Morris Island Approach to Fort Sumter</i></span></h2>
<p>Folly Island and Cole&rsquo;s Island, next south of Morris Island, had been
occupied by Northern troops just prior to the naval attack. In June and
July, the northern end of Folly Island was fortified. In a remarkable
operation, 47 guns and mortars were secretly placed &ldquo;within speaking
distance of the enemy&rsquo;s pickets.&rdquo; Some 11,000 men were concentrated
on the island. Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore, the &ldquo;breacher&rdquo; of Fort
Pulaski, assumed command on June 12. Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren
superseded Admiral Du Pont on July 6.</p>

</div>
<p>During that time the Confederates mounted guns at the southern end
of Morris Island and built up the earthworks at its upper end&mdash;Battery
Gregg at Cummings Point and Battery Wagner some 1,400 yards to the
south. The latter work, commanding the island at its narrowest point,
was made into a formidable &ldquo;sand fort&rdquo; mounting about 15 guns.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter, 1,390 yards distant from Battery Gregg, prepared for
siege, too. Brick and stone masonry &ldquo;counterforts,&rdquo; already built at each
extremity of the esplanade as protection for the magazines, were now
strengthened, and much of the remaining gorge exterior was sandbagged,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
or otherwise protected. The casemates on the right flank (&ldquo;sea front&rdquo;)
were filled with sand, and the rooms on the gorge were filled with damp
cotton bales laid in sand. The upper-tier magazines were abandoned and
filled with sandbags to protect the magazines below. Protective revetments
and defensive devices of various sorts were introduced at various
points throughout the fort. During this period the garrison was host at
frequent intervals to officers on leave, citizens of Charleston, and even
many ladies, who came to see the scars of the April battle, to admire the
drill, or to observe the preparations. At the end of June 1863, Fort Sumter
was garrisoned with 5 companies (perhaps 500 men) of the First
South Carolina Artillery, under the command of Col. Alfred Rhett. Its
armament, meanwhile, had been reduced to 68 guns and mortars, many
of the finest pieces having been removed to strengthen other fortifications
about the harbor.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 10, 3,000 Union infantrymen, supported by
the artillery on Folly Island and the guns of 4 monitors, descended on
the southern end of Morris Island. Brig. Gen. Truman Seymour, a company
commander at Fort Sumter 2 years before, commanded the assault.
Within 4 hours, three-fourths of Morris Island was in his hands. Hopelessly
outgunned and outmanned, the Confederate forces fell back to
Battery Wagner. The guns of Fort Sumter helped to cover the retreat.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; assault upon Wagner the following morning failed,
though the parapet was briefly gained. General Gillmore established
counterbatteries and tried again on the 18th. From noon until nightfall
that day &ldquo;without cessation or intermission,&rdquo; Federal guns poured a
&ldquo;storm of shot and shell upon Fort Wagner ... perhaps unequalled in
history&rdquo;; then, some 6,000 troops assaulted&mdash;in the van, the 54th Massachusetts,
&ldquo;the first colored regiment of the North to go to war.&rdquo; In a
short savage struggle, Seymour&rsquo;s force suffered 1,500 casualties. Though
one angle of the fort was gained and held for a time, the attack was
repulsed.</p>
<p>Thwarted in his plan to secure easy possession of Morris Island as a
base for breaching operations against Fort Sumter, General Gillmore
now determined to attempt that fort&rsquo;s reduction from the ground already
in his possession. Batteries Wagner and Gregg would be taken by protracted
siege operations. At Fort Sumter, removal of guns and ammunition
continued apace. Anticipating that Sumter was &ldquo;liable to be silenced
sooner or later,&rdquo; and fearing attack at other points about the harbor, the
Confederate authorities husbanded their resources. By mid-August, Fort
Sumter&rsquo;s armament was reduced to a safe minimum of 38 guns and 2
mortars.</p>
<p>At distances of 2 to 2&frac12; miles from Fort Sumter&mdash;distances extraordinary
for such operations&mdash;Gillmore set up eight batteries of heavy rifled
cannon. In the marsh west of Morris Island, where the mud was &ldquo;like
liquid,&rdquo; his engineers successfully emplaced a &ldquo;200 pounder&rdquo; to fire on
Charleston; this was to be the notorious &ldquo;Swamp Angel.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br /><span class="small"><i>The First Great Bombardment of Fort Sumter</i></span></h2>
<p>After some experimental firing starting August 12, the bombardment of
Fort Sumter began in earnest on August 17. Nearly 1,000 shells were
hurled at the fort that first day; nearly 5,000 more during the week following.
Even at the end of the first day it was obvious that Fort Sumter
was never intended to withstand &ldquo;200 pound Yankee Parrotts.&rdquo; Then, 3
days later, a 13-ton monster throwing 250-pound shells was added, making
18 rifled cannon in action. Because of the range involved, the fort
could not reply to the land batteries, and the monitors presented
themselves only fleetingly.</p>
<p>On the 21st, with the &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo; in position, Gillmore demanded
the evacuation of Fort Sumter and Morris Island, threatening direct fire
on the city of Charleston. Gillmore&rsquo;s ultimatum was unsigned, and General
Beauregard was absent from his headquarters; but before confirmation
could be secured, Gillmore had opened fire on the city. But little damage
had been done when, on the 36th round, the &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo; burst.
Meanwhile, Beauregard had delivered an indignant reply. The bombardment
of Fort Sumter continued.</p>
<p>By the 24th, General Gillmore was able to report the &ldquo;practical demolition&rdquo;
of the fort. On that date, only one gun remained &ldquo;serviceable in
action.&rdquo; On the morning of the 23d, against Dahlgren&rsquo;s ironclads, Fort
Sumter had fired what were to be its last shots in action. Its brick masonry
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
walls were shattered and undermined; a breach 8 by 10 feet yawned in
the upper casemates of the left face; at points, the sloped debris of the
walls already provided a practicable route for assault.</p>
<p>Still, the Confederate garrison, supplemented by a force of 200 to 400
Negroes, labored night and day, strengthening and repairing. The debris,
accumulating above the sand- and cotton-filled rooms, itself bolstered
the crumbling walls. On August 26, General Beauregard ordered Fort
Sumter held &ldquo;to the last extremity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bombardment continued sporadically during the week following.
On the night of September 1-2, the ironclads moved against the fort&mdash;the
first major naval operation against Fort Sumter since the preceding
April. Attempts earlier in the week had been thwarted by circumstance;
now, conditions were right. For 5 hours, the frigate <i>New Ironsides</i> and
five monitors bombarded the fort, now without a gun with which to
reply to the &ldquo;sneaking sea-devils.&rdquo; Two hundred and forty-five shot and
shell were hurled against the ruin&mdash;twice as many as were thrown in
the April attack. Then, tidal conditions, as much as a &ldquo;rapid and
sustained&rdquo; fire from Fort Moultrie, forced the monitors&rsquo; withdrawal.</p>

</div>
<p>Some desultory firing on the 2d brought to a close the first sustained
bombardment of Fort Sumter. Over 7,300 rounds had been hurled against
the fort since the opening of fire on August 17. With the fort, to all
intents, reduced to a &ldquo;shapeless and harmless mass of ruins,&rdquo; the Federal
commanders now concentrated on Battery Wagner, to which General
Gillmore&rsquo;s sappers had come within 100 yards.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 5, Federal cannoneers commenced a
devastating barrage against that work. For 42 hours, night and day, in
a spectacle &ldquo;of surpassing sublimity and grandeur,&rdquo; 17 mortars and 9
rifled cannon, as well as the powerful guns of the ironclads, pounded the
earthwork. Calcium lights &ldquo;turned night into day.&rdquo; On the night of September
6-7, the Confederate garrisons at Wagner and Gregg evacuated;
Morris Island, after 58 days, was at last in the hands of Union troops.
Just three-quarters of a mile away stood Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>Sumter remained defiant. When Admiral Dahlgren demanded the
fort&rsquo;s surrender, on the morning of the 7th, General Beauregard sent
word that the admiral could have it when he could &ldquo;take it and hold it.&rdquo;
On September 4 the garrison had been relieved with fresh troops&mdash;320
strong. Maj. Stephen Elliott succeeded to the command.</p>
<p>Admiral Dahlgren &ldquo;immediately designed to put into operation a plan
to capture Fort Sumter.&rdquo; As a preliminary, the monitor <i>Weehawken</i> was
ordered to pass in around Cummings Point &ldquo;to cut off all communication
by that direction.&rdquo; Later in the day, the <i>New Ironsides</i> and the
remaining ironclads were to move up &ldquo;to feel, and if possible, pass&rdquo; the
obstructions believed to be in the channel north of Sumter. But the
Weehawken grounded, and the monitors caught such a severe fire from
Fort Moultrie and the other Confederate batteries on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island,
that Admiral Dahlgren &ldquo;deemed it best to give [his] entire attention to
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the <i>Weehawken</i>&rdquo; and withdraw. Whatever his original plan, Admiral
Dahlgren now determined upon a small-boat assault. The task seemed
simple; there was &ldquo;nothing but a corporal&rsquo;s guard in the fort ... all
we have to do is go and take possession.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Small-boat Assault</i></span></h2>
<p>On the night of September 8-9, 400 sailors and marines made the
attempt. A tug towed the small boats within 800 yards of the fort, then,
too awkwardly, cast them loose. In the darkness and confusion, plans
went awry. Without the benefit of a diversionary assault, two columns
advanced simultaneously upon the right flank of the fort.</p>
<p>The Confederate garrison coolly held fire till the leading boats were
in the act of landing, then let loose with a galling fire of musketry, hand
grenades, &ldquo;fire balls,&rdquo; grape and canister, brickbats, and masonry fragments.
At a signal from the fort, the Confederate gunboat <i>Chicora</i> steamed
out from the harbor and opened fire; Fort Moultrie &ldquo;fired like a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outer boats, the marines replied rapidly for a few minutes.
Some of the sailors ashore fired a few times from their revolvers, but for
the most part sought refuge in the embrasures or breaches of the wall.
It was all over in 20 minutes. Most of the boats did not even touch
shore. The Federal loss was 124 killed, wounded, and captured; 5 boats
were taken. A similar expedition from Gillmore&rsquo;s command was detained
by low tide in a creek west of Morris Island. Service rivalry had prevented
active cooperation that might have meant victory.</p>
<p>For 19 days following the small-boat assault, Fort Sumter was free of
attack; then, after a 6-day bombardment of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; proportions, for 23
days more. Damages sustained by the monitors in the Morris Island
operation, as much as fear of channel obstructions (a menace afterwards
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
proved greatly exaggerated) and Fort Moultrie&rsquo;s evidently increased firepower,
made Admiral Dahlgren reluctant to make another move at this
time. General Gillmore, engaged now in rebuilding and rearming the
captured Confederate batteries on Cummings Point, thought he had
accomplished his part of the operation. In his opinion, Fort Sumter was
effectively reduced; its seizure and occupation would be a costly and
unnecessary operation. Further offensive operations by his force had
never been contemplated; and the reenforcements needed for such operations
were not to be had. Indeed, with the &ldquo;turn of the tide&rdquo; at Vicksburg
and Gettysburg, Charleston had suddenly become much less important.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fort Sumter&rsquo;s garrison was not idle. It was at this time
that the great &ldquo;central bombproof,&rdquo; with quarters for 100 men, was built
out from the gorge interior and, in the remaining casemates of the right
face, a new 3-gun battery mounted.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Second Great Bombardment</i></span></h2>
<p>On October 26, &ldquo;on the strength of certain reports ... that the enemy
have recently been at work remounting some guns,&rdquo; Gillmore resumed
the bombardment; at least Fort Sumter could be &ldquo;kept down&rdquo; while the
Navy prepared. For the next 12 days, the concentration of fire was comparable
to the great bombardment of the preceding August. But now,
firing from the new batteries on Cummings Point, with range shortened
to less than a mile, the effect was far greater. For the first time, 16 heavy
mortars were in use&mdash;2 of them 8&frac12;-ton pieces (13-inch bore) throwing
200-pound projectiles. Their sharp, plunging fire was added to that of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
12 Parrott rifles&mdash;the types already used so effectively against the fort&mdash;and
1 powerful Columbiad. In addition, 2 monitors, with guns &ldquo;equal to
a dozen&rdquo; Parrotts, crossed fire with Gillmore&rsquo;s artillery.</p>
<p>Sumter&rsquo;s &ldquo;sea front&rdquo; (right flank), upright and relatively unscathed
till then, was breached now for nearly half its length. The ramparts
and arches of its upper casemates were cut down and the interior barracks
demolished. The accumulated debris made ascent easy inside and out.
Through the breach, the Federal guns took the channel fronts &ldquo;in
reverse.&rdquo; For the first time, these were exposed to direct fire; soon they
were &ldquo;cut and jagged.&rdquo; Still, the gorge ruin remained much the same; to
Admiral Dahlgren, that &ldquo;heap of rubbish&rdquo; looked &ldquo;invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night and day, Gillmore&rsquo;s batteries maintained a &ldquo;slow fire&rdquo; against
Fort Sumter throughout November and into December. On occasion
the monitors assisted. Sumter could return merely &ldquo;harmless musketry&rdquo;;
only telescopic rifle sights made even that much possible. But, the
&ldquo;rebels&rdquo; seemed &ldquo;snug in the ruins&rdquo;; and if Sumter was without guns,
Confederate batteries on James and Sullivan&rsquo;s Islands kept up an irritating
counterfire.</p>

</div>
<p>On November 6, the Confederate engineer at Fort Sumter reported
the bombproofs (quarters) unhurt. Although the height of the mass of
the fort was &ldquo;diminishing visibly on the sides away from the city,&rdquo; still,
&ldquo;when it gets down to the lower casemates [he wrote] it will have
become so thick from accumulated debris as to resist further battering.&rdquo;
Two weeks later, Major Johnson found the fort stronger than ever, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
casualties were &ldquo;either among those carelessly exposing themselves,
outside the bombproof, or obliged to do so when at work.&rdquo; Indeed,
casualties had been surprisingly low&mdash;only 2 men had been killed in the
bombardment of August and only 22 more since the start of the second
great bombardment; 118 had been wounded. Major Johnson did not
&ldquo;apprehend being run out by the big guns&rdquo;; his chief anxiety was over
&ldquo;exposure to assault from barges at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In mid-November such an attack seemed to be forthcoming. During
the early hours of the 18th, the defenders of the fort had &ldquo;four distinct
alarms&rdquo; as small boats approached within hailing distance; &ldquo;all hands
out each time and expecting a fight.&rdquo; On the following night, a force
estimated at 250 men approached within 300 yards of the fort, only to be
driven off by the muskets of the aroused garrison.</p>
<p>But General Gillmore had merely ordered a &ldquo;reconnaissance ... of
the nature of a simulated attack, with a view to compel the garrison to
show its strength.&rdquo; Nor would he make another attempt. The next move
remained up to the Navy.</p>
<p>Admiral Dahlgren continued to make no move. In any event, he could
not advance until the repairs on the monitors were finished. As late as
January 1864 these still were not complete. Meanwhile, in the face of
reports of greatly strengthened harbor fortifications other than Fort Sumter,
and increasingly concerned over the nature of the harbor obstructions,
he was reluctant now to move forward without additional monitors.
Defeat was always possible, and defeat for the Union&rsquo;s &ldquo;only ironclad
squadron&rdquo; might have serious consequences, not only for the blockade
and Gillmore&rsquo;s command on Morris Island, but for future operations
elsewhere along the coast. In the meantime, &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; advantages
had already been gained; the blockade at Charleston was tighter with
Morris Island in Federal hands. To all this, the Navy Department agreed.
Elsewhere, however, the war gathered momentum. In November, the
North won decisively at Chattanooga.</p>
<p>The additional monitors, always promised, never seemed to arrive. On
December 5, General Gillmore stopped the bombardment of Fort Sumter
begun 41 days earlier. There seemed no great advantage in continuing,
and it required considerable ammunition.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><br /><span class="small"><i>Stalemate&mdash;Spring of 1864</i></span></h2>
<p>The general had made his last sustained effort against the fort. On only
four other days in December did he fire any rounds at all. During the 4
months he remained in command the firing was intermittent, never more
than &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in character. Meanwhile, forthcoming operations in Virginia
required all the troops available. On May 1, 1864, General Gillmore
departed for Fort Monroe with 18,000 picked men and quantities of
valuable mat&eacute;riel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>General Grant&rsquo;s operations required the services of the additional
monitors awaited by Admiral Dahlgren. With the monitor force reduced
to six by the foundering of the <i>Weehawken</i> in December, further offensive
operations against Charleston seemed completely out of the question.
In June, the ironclad frigate <i>New Ironsides</i> was withdrawn to the north.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><br /><span class="small"><i>Fort Sumter Strengthened</i></span></h2>
<p>In the preceding December, Fort Sumter had been an &ldquo;almost chaotic
ruin.&rdquo; At night, below the &ldquo;rugged outline of the ramparts,&rdquo; wrote one
of the garrison, all was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;dark with piles of disordered material; a chance shower of sparks blows out from
smouldering fire and lights up some great rough blocks of brick work and the pools
of stagnant water into which they have been violently thrown some days before. Or
lanterns move about in unseen hands, some to light a way for long trains of men
toiling with heavy timbers and bags of sand over the roughest footing and up steep
and uncertain, tumbling slopes; some to direct the heaping of material over old damaged
hiding places repaired for the twentieth time since the firing began, or to build
up newer and more lasting shelters for the garrison....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the fort practically left alone during the months immediately
following, the garrison gradually restored order from chaos. The parade
ground, excavated well below high-water level to provide sand-filling,
was cleared, drained, and partially rebuilt. Trim ranks of gabions (wicker
baskets filled with sand) bolstered the sloping debris of the walls on the
interior. The three-gun battery in the lower right face was lined with
logs and planks, 10 feet deep, and revetted more thoroughly in the rear.
In casemates of the left flank another three-gun battery was created.
Through the disordered debris of the left and right faces, the garrison
tunneled a 275-foot timbered gallery connecting the two batteries and
fort headquarters in the left flank. In from the rubble of the &ldquo;sea front,&rdquo;
the garrison built a loopholed timber blockhouse to cover the parade
ground in the event of further assault. In May, Capt. John C. Mitchel,
son of the Irish patriot, relieved Lt. Col. Stephen Elliott in command.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br /><span class="small"><i>The Third Great Bombardment</i></span></h2>
<p>The onset of summer, 1864, brought one more attempt to take Fort
Sumter; likewise another officer of the original Fort Sumter garrison
came into the operation. Maj. Gen. J. G. Foster, engineer of the fort in
April 1861, succeeding to Gillmore&rsquo;s command on May 26, was convinced
that &ldquo;with proper arrangements&rdquo; the fort could easily be taken
&ldquo;at any time.&rdquo; The &ldquo;proper arrangements&rdquo; included special light-draft
steamers and 1,000-man &ldquo;assaulting arks&rdquo; equipped with elevated towers
for sharpshooters and 51-foot scaling ladders. Though initial War
Department reaction was cool, Foster went ahead with a preliminary
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
operation to complete the demolition of the fort. &ldquo;Yankee ingenuity&rdquo;
might succeed where routine operations had failed or been judged too
costly.</p>

</div>
<p>On July 7, 1864, Foster&rsquo;s batteries opened a sustained bombardment
against the ruin of Fort Sumter. During the remainder of that month,
an average of 350 rounds daily was hurled at the beleagured fort. In some
respects, this was the heaviest bombardment Fort Sumter had yet received.
Although the gorge ruin was wasted away at one point to within 20 feet
of the water, and the shattered &ldquo;sea front&rdquo; was still further reduced, the
right face remained erect, its three-gun battery intact, likewise most of
the left flank. To Admiral Dahlgren, as late as July 21, the work seemed
&ldquo;nearly impregnable.&rdquo; Debris added to debris, feverish work day and
night, and thousands of bags of sand brought from the city by night
actually made the fort stronger than ever. If a casemate were breached,
it was speedily filled; if the slopes of the ruin invited assault, a bristling
array of wooden pikes and barbed-wire entanglements were provided;
and there were always the muskets of the 300-man garrison.</p>
<p>The fire slackened in August; Foster&rsquo;s supply of ammunition was
dwindling. A scheme for &ldquo;shaking down&rdquo; the fort walls by floating down
large &ldquo;powder rafts&rdquo; failed miserably. Mid-August brought final War
Department refusal to supply light-draft steamers; the end of August,
sharp disapproval for Foster&rsquo;s &ldquo;assaulting arks.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Admiral
Dahlgren had been unwilling to cooperate in an alternate plan of assault.</p>
<p>With his requisitions for more ammunition unfilled, General Foster
was now called upon to ship north most of his remaining ammunition
and four more regiments of troops to be used in Grant&rsquo;s operations
against Richmond. Foster was ordered to remain strictly on the defensive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>On September 4, the bombardment begun on July 7 came to an end.
In the 61 days, another 14,666 rounds had been hurled against the fort.
Sixteen of the garrison had been killed, 65 wounded. On July 20, Captain
Mitchel fell mortally wounded. Capt. Thomas A. Huguenin succeeded
him that night.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><br /><span class="small"><i>Sherman&rsquo;s March Forces Sumter&rsquo;s Evacuation</i></span></h2>
<p>The last great bombardment of Fort Sumter had taken place. The firing
was no more than desultory after September 1864; less than a hundred
rounds were hurled at the fort in the months of December and January;
none at all in February. During the autumn months it was all Foster&rsquo;s
batteries could do to make a &ldquo;decent defense&rdquo; of Morris Island, let alone
carry on any offensive operations. Wrote one of the commanders in
mid-September:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The shelling from the enemy&rsquo;s mortars was severe ... and having but little
mortar powder, we were unable to reply effectually.... I regret that our ordnance
supplies are so scanty.... No powder for the mortars; no suitable fuses for the fire
on Charleston; no shells for the 30-pounder Parrotts, a most useful gun for silencing
the enemy&rsquo;s fire; no material for making cartridge bags, or grease for lubricating the
projectiles.... More ammunition for the 300-pounder, the most useful guns in
these works, is also very much needed....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Sumter itself was more than irritating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Within the last 2 days the work ... has been greatly interfered with by a corps
of sharpshooters ... stationed on Fort Sumter. The bullets came in very thick when
I was at the front this morning....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 1865, the long stalemate came to an end. In that month,
General Sherman commenced his march north from Savannah through
the interior of South Carolina, slicing between the remnants of Hood&rsquo;s
army on the west and the small Confederate force remaining along the
coast. On the 17th, with Sherman in Columbia, Fort Sumter and the
other Confederate fortifications in Charleston harbor were quietly evacuated.
At 9 o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 18th, the United States flag
was once more raised over Fort Sumter. The fortunes of war had accomplished
what 3,500 tons of metal, a fleet of ironclads, and thousands of
men had failed to do.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><br /><span class="small"><i>Major Anderson Returns</i></span></h2>
<p>On April 14, 1865, Robert Anderson, now a retired brigadier general,
returned to Fort Sumter to raise again the flag he had pulled down 4
years before. The guns of the harbor thundered in salute. In an address
before the throng of spectators brought down from New York, Henry
Ward Beecher said:</p>

<h2 id="c19"><br /><span class="small"><i>Fort Sumter After 1865</i></span></h2>
<p>In the 1870&rsquo;s the rubble and ruin of war were cleared from the interior
of Fort Sumter, and the work of reconstruction began. The outer walls
of the gorge and right flank, largely destroyed by the bombardments,
were partially rebuilt. The other walls of the fort, left jagged and torn
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
30 to 40 feet above water, were leveled to approximately half their original
height. Through the left flank a new sally port was constructed.
Within the reconstructed walls of the fort, the earth and concrete works
for a 10-gun battery <i>en barbette</i> (guns fired from an open parapet) began
to take shape.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig39">

<p class="pcap"><b><i>Interior of the Gorge as seen from atop the Left Flank, February 1865. The central bombproof is at the left.</i></b></p>
</div>
<p>Operations were well advanced, when, in June 1876, shortage of funds
forced complete suspension of activity. Only three permanent barbette
platforms had been constructed by that time. Of necessity, seven temporary
(wooden) platforms remained; on these, four &ldquo;200 pounder&rdquo; Parrott
rifles and two 15-inch Rodman smoothbores had been mounted. In a
modification of the original plan, 11 lower-tier gunrooms of the original
fort along the right face and about the salient had been recovered and
armed with &ldquo;100 pounder&rdquo; Parrotts. In a gradually deteriorating state,
these 17 guns constituted Fort Sumter&rsquo;s armament for the next 23 years.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>From 1876 to 1898, Fort Sumter stood largely neglected, important
mainly as a lighthouse station. Ungarrisoned, most of that time it was in
the charge of a &ldquo;fortkeeper&rdquo; or an ordnance sergeant. Without proper
funds for maintenance, Fort Sumter, even then visited by thousands each
year, fell into a state of dilapidation. By 1887 the wooden platforms of
the barbette guns had rotted away so that &ldquo;not one gun could be safely
fired&rdquo;; the neat earth slopes had eroded into &ldquo;irregular mounds&rdquo;; and
quantities of sand had drifted into the parade ground. The casemate guns
rusted so that they could not be traversed; salt water dashed freely
through the open embrasures, the shutters of which were no longer in
working order.</p>
<p>The Spanish-American War, 1898, prompted the construction in 1899
of a battery of two long-range rifled cannon at Fort Sumter. The massive
concrete emplacement for this battery (named for Isaac Huger, South
Carolinian, general in the American Revolution) dominates the central
portion of Fort Sumter today. The guns, long since outmoded, were
removed about 1941. During World War II, Fort Sumter was armed with
90-mm. antiaircraft guns manned by a garrison of Coast Artillery.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>1. <span class="small">LEFT-FLANK EXTERIOR.</span> Entrance to Fort Sumter is by way of a
modern sally port built through the center of the fort&rsquo;s left flank.
This sally port, erected after the Civil War, replaced a gun embrasure.
The two 13-inch mortars mounted outside this entry serve as
the visitor&rsquo;s introduction to the ordnance now located at Fort Sumter.
In 1863-65 Federal troops on Morris Island used this type of
mortar against the fort. A marker on the left flank near the sally
port honors the Confederate defenders of Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>2. <span class="small">LEFT-FLANK CASEMATES.</span> The casemates (gunrooms) of the lower
tier on the left flank were surmounted by a second tier identical in
appearance. Above the second-tier casemates, guns were mounted <i>en
barbette</i> on an open terreplein. This arrangement was also used on
the fort&rsquo;s right flank and on its right and left faces. Each casemate
contained one gun, which could be moved on a track for crossfiring
through the embrasure. Fort Sumter was designed for an armament
of 135 guns and a garrison of 650 men. There are now two
guns mounted on the casemate carriages in the left flank. The one
on the left of the sally port is a rifled and banded &ldquo;42-pounder&rdquo;;
the one on the right is a 42-pound smoothbore. Shielded (by the
mass of the gorge) from Federal guns on Morris Island, 1863-65,
the left flank casemates were used as a Confederate headquarters and
hospital. The lower half of the outer wall retained its full height
until the end of the siege, but was leveled to approximately half its
original height during the 1870&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>3. <span class="small">ENLISTED MEN&rsquo;S BARRACKS.</span> Inside and parallel to the left flank
are the ruins of an enlisted men&rsquo;s barracks. This building, three
stories high, rose slightly above the fort walls. The first floor contained
the kitchen and mess facilities, with sleeping quarters on the
two upper floors. Another barracks for enlisted men, identical to
this one, was located on the right flank.</p>
<p>4. <span class="small">OFFICERS&rsquo; QUARTERS.</span> Along the gorge (or back wall) was another
3-story brick building, the officers&rsquo; quarters. In addition to
furnishing lodging to the officers of Fort Sumter, this building also
housed the administrative offices, storerooms, powder magazines, and
jail. Most of the wooden parts of the building burned during the
initial Confederate bombardment. While the fort was in Confederate
hands, many of the rooms were filled with sand and bales of
cotton to strengthen the gorge.</p>
<p>5. <span class="small">GARRISON MONUMENT.</span> The U.S. Government erected this monument
in 1932 &ldquo;... in memory of the garrison defending Fort Sumter
during the bombardment April 12-14, 1861.&rdquo; The roster of the
original garrison is listed on the tablet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>6. <span class="small">PARADE.</span> In 1899, when Battery Huger was built in the center
of the ruins of Fort Sumter, the remainder of the fort was filled with
sand to strengthen it against guns of that period. In 1959 the National
Park Service completed excavations that uncovered the entire
left side of Fort Sumter down to the level of the original parade.
Most of the fill on the right side is still in place.</p>
<p>7. <span class="small">LEFT FACE.</span> Union guns destroyed the arched brick casemates of
the left face during the Civil War. When Union gunners, firing
on the gorge of Fort Sumter from Morris Island, aimed too high,
their projectiles crossed the parade and struck the interior of the left
face. Holes caused by these reverse shots, and even shells themselves,
are still seen in the ruins of the left-face casemates. Just inside
these casemates are two 15-inch smoothbore Rodman guns.
They were part of Fort Sumter&rsquo;s post-Civil War armament.</p>
<p>8. <span class="small">RIGHT FACE.</span> Guns mounted on the lower tier of this face dueled
with Fort Moultrie in the initial attack, April 12-14, 1861. Since
the angle of the face allowed it to escape broadsides from Federal
batteries on Morris Island, its outer wall still stood almost at full
height in February 1865. After Fort Sumter was silenced in August
1863, the Confederate garrison mounted three guns in the first-tier
casemates just above the right shoulder angle. This was the &ldquo;Palmetto
Battery,&rdquo; called thus because of the protective log cover raised
on the exterior. For several months this battery was the sole armament
of the fort. All the lower-tier casemates were reclaimed in
the 1870&rsquo;s and armed with &ldquo;100-pounder&rdquo; Parrott rifled cannon.
These guns, rusted and worn, were buried with the casemates just
before Battery Huger was constructed. To open these casemates,
parade-ground excavations were extended into this part of the fort.
Eleven 100-pound Parrott guns were uncovered and are now displayed
in this face.</p>
<p>9. <span class="small">THE FLAGPOLE MONUMENT.</span> The Fort Sumter flagpole is a monument
honoring Major Anderson and his garrison. It was erected
by Eba Anderson Lawton, daughter of Major Anderson, and accepted
by Congress on May 11, 1928.</p>
<p>10. <span class="small">MUSEUM.</span> Exhibits in the Fort Sumter Museum graphically relate
the entire history of the fort. Informational literature and post cards
can be obtained at the information desk. The gunroom for the
12-inch disappearing gun of Battery Huger was adapted to house the
exhibits for this museum, which was dedicated April 12, 1961.</p>
<p>11. <span class="small">ORIENTATION CIRCLE.</span> This point atop Battery Huger is almost
in the center of old Fort Sumter. On either side are the 12-inch
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
gun emplacements of Battery Huger; the one toward the salient
was converted into the museum. The area stretching out from this
point to the right flank wall is earth fill, the height of which averages
20 feet above the original parade ground. In the center of the
orientation circle is a model of Fort Sumter, oriented exactly with
the fort.</p>
<p>12. <span class="small">RIGHT-GORGE ANGLE.</span> From a gun in the first tier casemates,
Capt. Abner Doubleday fired the first shot from Fort Sumter on April
12, 1861. Also in this section of the fort occurred the deepest penetration
of Confederate shot and shell in the initial attack. In part,
this was the work of the Confederates&rsquo; rifled gun, the first one fired in
action in America.</p>
<p>13. <span class="small">ESPLANADE.</span> A 25&frac12;-foot-wide promenade and landing space once
lined the full length of the gorge exterior at its base. Out from
the center of the esplanade ran the original stone wharf, 171 feet long.
Through the gorge, at the head of the wharf, was the original sally
port to the fort.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
